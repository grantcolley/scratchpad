Dictionary<TKey,TValue> is based on a hashtable that represents a collection of key/value pairs that
are organized based on the hash code of the key.
    - internally values are stored in buckets, which are indexed by the key's HashCode 
    - Every key must be unique
    - The speed of retrieval depends on the quality of the hashing algorithm.
